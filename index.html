								<h2>Projects</h2>

							<p>These are some of the projects that I enjoyed doing. The major gain from these projects was not to only in terms of technical knowledge but also in other aspects such as staying under budget constraints, dividing work in teams, reacting to failures (often times!) and the nights spent at the labs. </p>

										  </div>
										  <div class="modal-content" style="font-size:70%; text-align: left">
											<p> As a part of Dynamics of Machines Course, our group developed an acrylic bending machine. My work was to design and develop the entire electronics and control stack. 
												Initially, the machine was manually controlled by controlling the voltage but to make it easier to use, a temperature controller was added. Currently, it is in use at Ahmedabad University Mechanical Engineering Lab. My work on the project was:	
											<ul> 
											<li> Decide which electronic components to purchase based on temperature requirements while constraining to the budget.</li>
											<li> Develop a system with feedback of thermocouple to control temperature (Algorithm used: PI control, Exponential Smoothing)</li>
											<li> Develop the algorithm of how the machine has to be operated (manual/autonomous/safety features)</li>
											<li> Design and fabricate the circuit board.</li>

										  <div class="modal-content" style="font-size:70%; text-align: left">
											<p>
												This is my undergrad capstone project. A quadrotor flight controller was designed from scratch on STM32 and ESP32. 
												The second part of the project was to design pattern formation algorithm with obstacle avoidance. To aid in faster development, I designed tools such as swarm simulator and automatic PID tuner (based on dynamic model).
												The simulator helped in implementing different algorithms without risking hardware damage and was incredibly useful during covid-19 lockdown.
